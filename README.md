# Triangle Voting Escrow

## Introduction

Triangle Voting Escrow (TVE) implements voting with linearly vesting tokens. In traditional voting escrow models, participants had their entire supply locked until a cliff to prevent any sort of selling. This ultimately hurt long-term stakers, as they were completely locked in while others chose not to stake, creating an imbalance in choices.

TVE offers a more balanced approach: participants can stake enough to engage meaningfully in governance, while still having the option to DCA out as tokens vest. By introducing this flexibility, TVE removes the psychological barrier to staking and makes long-term alignment feel less like a trap.
